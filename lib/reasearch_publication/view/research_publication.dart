We collected data of customers comments from the âSundorban Currier Servicesâ, âRedx Currier Servicesâ and âPathao Delivery Systemâ official social media page are verified posts. In this sentiment review, we have used Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Bangla to categorize those reviews using multiple machine learning models. In those models, we have tried to discover the number of negative and positive reviews or comments in real- life social media platforms and predicted the reviews that are negative or positive using the Unigram, Bigram, and Trigram methods.We have found that the Bigram feature is the best for this analysis because it has the highest accuracy of 90.72% and according to that the highest F1 score is 91.26. Using the Bangla NLP approach, the machine learning models are categorized in negative and positive reviews with the sentiment analysis method.",
